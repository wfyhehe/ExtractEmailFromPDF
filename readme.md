1. drag your files (*pdf|docx|txt*) or dirs in this path (we can read all of them recursively)
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python execute.py` (be patient, probably cost minutes)
4. get your .csv in `./output_csv`

for .doc(really a hot potato!), please *google* methods to convert .doc to .docx|.pdf|.txt on your *os*
Please convert them before run this py.
